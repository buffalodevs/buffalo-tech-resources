## Google Workspace (formerly G-Suite)

### Personal Experience/Recommendations

Terry Westley, 11/6/2020: I've been using G-Suite for many years for a couple of email addresses, calendar, and contacts. I love G-Suite email and especially search for some 20,000 emails. There are lots of good and positive reviews of the office apps. I don't use them much because I have Office 365 Family. But you can't get email, calendar, and contacts alone with Google Workspace. You're paying for all the services even if you don't use them. For two users, I now pay $156/year (2 users * $6/mo plus tax). I'd like to add more users but it's getting too pricey per user. I'm looking into alternatives.

### Personal Experience/Recommendations

Terry Westley, 11/6/2020: I'm investigating this Swiss company for email only (Micro plan, $20/year). So far, I've modified the MX records at my registrar and created one email account for one of my domains and added it to my **free** Google email account. This gives me the benefits of Google search and 15GB of space without paying for Google Workspace. Very easy. Email works fine at this scale.

## Proton Mail

Distinctives: Free encrypted email

### Personal Experience/Recommendations

Terry Westley, 11/6/2020: I have used Proton Mail for exchanging confidential medical info with small financial services providers (Medicare brokers) who don't have their own private message services like the big financial services companies (e.g. Fidelity). I started using it prior to COVID mainly to avoid trips to drop off physical paper. Now it's even more useful when I'm not physically going to advisors' offices in-person.
